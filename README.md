# Elle

A Racket-like language with reimagined syntax and updated features.

Goals for the language include (all WIP):

- Immutable data is emphasized but not required
- Encourage well-structured, higher-order programming
- Clearly and easily track and manage effects
- Provide generic interfaces instead of overly concrete ones
- Reduce unnecessary/confusing variety of interfaces
- Streamline common patterns
- Remove/replace outdated interfaces
- Sophisticated metaprogramming

Note that paradigms are not mentioned, in part because programming paradigms
are vaguely-defined, and also because, since Elle is a dialect of Racket,
any programming technique or language can be easily embedded into or built
on top of the core language.

Note that, while I (Kelly) hope that many programmers will find Elle useful,
I am imparting many of my ideas and preferences, so you may find this
language to be more opinionated than Racket or ⟨your favorite lang⟩.
